Ninja_MVP
=========

It's a action-based multi-player shooting game using Leap Motion to track a player's hand movements and gestures for control.

It adopts a scoring mechanism using principles of Game Theory, where in order to get highest score, a player can, depending on the best utility at the moment, choose to:
1) shoot simple target to get base score;
2) shoot complex target to get much higher score by shooting it together with simultaneously with another player;
3) shoot the other player to reduce her score.

To make the game more visually fancy and fun, the game temporarily uses figures and scenes from <Naruto>, a Japanese ninja cartoon which is also the game authors' favorite. All images and sound effects are fetched from internet, which authors use for game demo ONLY and do not own any copyright for, and the game will never used for commercial publication with.
